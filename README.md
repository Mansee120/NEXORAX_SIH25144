     🧩  What the Project Does 

- Our project introduces a  lightweight, foldable, IoT-enabled smart crutch  designed to improve mobility, safety, posture, and rehabilitation outcomes for users.
- It integrates multiple sensors, fall detection + ML-based fall prediction, health tracking, emergency alerts, and a mobile application for real-time monitoring.
- The device also includes a  built-in foldable chair ,  shock absorber ,  auto-LED , and  Frequency Dependent energy harvesting .



     🎯  Problem Statement 

Traditional crutches cause:

 - Underarm pain, nerve compression, and wrist strain
 - No real-time feedback about user health or gait
 - No protection against falls
 - No smart features like posture guidance, alerts, or clinical monitoring
 - Inconvenient, bulky designs with no portability
